Some WIP, some complete, ideas that were attempted in JS

Contact - Based on the book/movie Contact, a signal is detected that emits a pulse for the value every prime number. Example:

Pulse
Pulse
<pause>
Pulse
Pulse
Pulse
<pause>
Pulse
Pulse
Pulse
Pulse
Pulse
<pause>
...
  
As of now it can print everything, all at once. Currently looking into implementing an Interval between each print and during each "pause".
